P: Run on  64x64, overnight
Z: Good model, 3e-4

maybe retrain binary

binary -> unet -> val dice -> submit
2nd to last - last weights

or new architecture


AO is efficientnet-b0 Unet with good learning rate
AQ is mask only
AU is Unet with binary classifier in the middle

AV is efficientnet-b1 unet
